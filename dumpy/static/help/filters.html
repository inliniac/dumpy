<p>
  The filter can be a valid libpcap filter or "fast" style event
  from Snort or Suricata. For examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    11/15-16:38:34.709301 [**] [1:498:8] INDICATOR-COMPROMISE
    id check returned root [**] [Classification: Potentially
    Bad Traffic] [Priority: 2] {TCP} 217.160.51.31:80 ->
    172.16.1.11:33188
  </li>
  <li>
    11/15/2012-16:38:38.574576 [**] [1:2100498:7] GPL
    ATTACK_RESPONSE id check returned root [**]
    [Classification: Potentially Bad Traffic] [Priority: 2]
    {TCP} 217.160.51.31:80 -> 172.16.1.11:33189
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The filter may also be a partial event, for example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>{TCP} 172.16.1.240:57522 -> 199.7.59.72:80</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Due to lack of time zone information in "fast" style events,
  the timestamp will be treated as server side local time.
